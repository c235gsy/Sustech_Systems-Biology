\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} 
Since the discovery of the cell in 1665, scientists have been working to classify cells and build cell lineage. In the process, scientists have developed a variety of methods and made some great achievements. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has developed rapidly, and researchers have developed a number of single-cell trajectory inference tools that can use single-cell sequencing data to classify cells and build cell lineage, turning research of cellular dynamic processes into analysis of the pseudo-time series and greatly improved analysis throughput. Some ambitious scientists also hope to use this technology to construct “The Human Cell Atlas”. The existing scTI methods have achieved many achievements. In some simple cell differentiation systems, scientists have used these methods to ﬁnd answers to many important biological problems. The paper also lists 20 commonly used scTI methods and 7 basic topologies in the cell lineage, and organizes and summarizes the basic information of these methods and their adaptability to various basic topologies. At the same time, in fact, cell lineage studies based on single-cell biology are still in the early stages of development, and scientists need more powerful sequencing techniques and better-performing core algorithms to further develop these scTI research strategies. In future biological research, especially after scientists have successfully mapped the complete “The Human Cell Atlas” and the cell lineage of various model animals, single-cell-based cell lineage and classiﬁcation studies will provide a powerful boost to the development of biology.
