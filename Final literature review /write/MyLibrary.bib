A new application of single-cell whole-transcriptomics is the unbiased ordering of cells according to their progression along a dynamic process of interest. We introduce {SCORPIUS}, a method which can effectively reconstruct an ordering of individual cells without any prior information about the dynamic process. Comprehensive evaluation using ten {scRNA}-seq datasets shows that {SCORPIUS} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. We used {SCORPIUS} to generate novel hypotheses regarding dendritic cell development, which were subsequently validated in vivo. This work enables data-driven investigation and characterization of dynamic processes and lays the foundation for objective benchmarking of future trajectory inference methods.},

	abstract = {Advances in {RNA}-seq technologies provide unprecedented insight into the variability and heterogeneity of gene expression at the single-cell level. However, such data offers only a snapshot of the transcriptome, whereas it is often the progression of cells through dynamic biological processes that is of interest. As a result, one outstanding challenge is to infer such progressions by ordering gene expression from single cell data alone, known as the cell ordering problem. Here, we introduce a new method that constructs a low-dimensional non-linear embedding of the data using laplacian eigenmaps before assigning each cell a pseudotime using principal curves. We characterise why on a theoretical level our method is more robust to the high levels of noise typical of single-cell {RNA}-seq data before demonstrating its utility on two existing datasets of differentiating cells.},

	volume = {53},
	issn = {0023-2173},
	abstract = {A new method for the measurement of renin in human plasma is described. The method is based on the introduction of the internationally available renin standard of the Medical Research Council ({MRC}) London, as a calibration system. Thus, some principal disadvantages of methods expressing results in renin reaction velocity (angiotensin generation rate) only are avoided. Both renins, unknown and standard, react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin I radioimmunoassay ({RIA}). The plasma renin concentration ({PRC}) is given in 10(-6) {MRC}-renin units ({muM}/ml).
{RESULTS}: the renin standard is free of angiotensin, angiotensinases, and angiotensinogen; it is stable on storage. Identical enzyme kinetics are shown for both renins. An interference between endogenous and exogenous substrate could be avoided. The potentially harmful influences of proteins from the enzyme incubation mixture of the {RIA} dose response curve are shown. The use of an angiotensin I calibration system could be omitted. Using a standard renin dilution from 250-0.9 {muU}/ml also the full biological range is covered. When giving an unrestricted diet the preliminary normal values of {PRC} are 21.9 +/- 12.6 {muU}/ml in recumbent and 40.1 +/- 19.8 {muU}/ml in upright position (n = 16,x +/- s, age 20-35 years). Earlier findings of age-dependency of {PRC} were confirmed.},

The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.},

Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a reference model and general framework for studying hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution.},

	abstract = {Waddington's epigenetic landscape is probably the most famous and most powerful metaphor in developmental biology. Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys. Each new valley represents a possible cell fate and the ridges between the valleys maintain the cell fate once it has been chosen. Here I examine models of two important developmental processes - cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition - and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation - a saddle-node bifurcation - that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell-cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell-cell competition.},

Partition-based graph abstraction ({PAGA}) provides an interpretable graph-like map of the arising data manifold, based on estimating connectivity of manifold partitions (https://github.com/theislab/paga). {PAGA} maps provide interpretable discrete and continuous latent coordinates for both disconnected and continuous structure in data, preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow -- one million cells take on the order of a minute, a speedup of 130 times compared to {UMAP}. We demonstrate the method by inferring structure-rich cell maps with consistent topology across four hematopoietic datasets, confirm the reconstruction of lineage relations of adult planaria and the zebrafish embryo, benchmark computational performance on a neuronal dataset and detect a  biological trajectory in one deep-learning processed image dataset.},

	shorttitle = {A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods},
	abstract = {Using single-cell -omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, {TSCAN} and Monocle {DDRTree}, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively evaluated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers. These discussions can be held at github.com/dynverse/dynverse/issues.},

Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.},

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed {PhenoGraph}, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. {PhenoGraph} revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into {AML} pathophysiology.},

Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells ({CSCs}) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for {CSCs} in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six {IDH}1 or {IDH}2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which {CSCs} are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation ({CNV}) shows that distinct {CNV} sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of oxygen, although central to life, produces reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) that have been implicated in processes as diverse as cancer, cardiovascular disease and ageing. It has recently been shown that central nervous system stem cells and haematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors contain lower levels of {ROS} than their more mature progeny, and that these differences are critical for maintaining stem cell function. We proposed that epithelial tissue stem cells and their cancer stem cell ({CSC}) counterparts may also share this property. Here we show that normal mammary epithelial stem cells contain lower concentrations of {ROS} than their more mature progeny cells. Notably, subsets of {CSCs} in some human and murine breast tumours contain lower {ROS} levels than corresponding non-tumorigenic cells ({NTCs}). Consistent with {ROS} being critical mediators of ionizing-radiation-induced cell killing, {CSCs} in these tumours develop less {DNA} damage and are preferentially spared after irradiation compared to {NTCs}. Lower {ROS} levels in {CSCs} are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems. Pharmacological depletion of {ROS} scavengers in {CSCs} markedly decreases their clonogenicity and results in radiosensitization. These results indicate that, similar to normal tissue stem cells, subsets of {CSCs} in some tumours contain lower {ROS} levels and enhanced {ROS} defences compared to their non-tumorigenic progeny, which may contribute to tumour radioresistance.},

We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive ({ER}(+)) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies ({\textless}10\%) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3×), whereas the {ER}(+) tumour cells did not.

Our previous studies have shown that, in acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}), mutation acquisition occurs in functionally normal hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}). These preleukemic {HSCs} harbor some, but not all, of the mutations found in the leukemic cells. We report here the identification of patterns of mutation acquisition in human {AML}. Our findings support a model in which mutations in "landscaping" genes, involved in global chromatin changes such as {DNA} methylation, histone modification, and chromatin looping, occur early in the evolution of {AML}, whereas mutations in "proliferative" genes occur late. Additionally, we analyze the persistence of preleukemic mutations in patients in remission and find {CD}34+ progenitor cells and various mature cells that harbor preleukemic mutations. These findings indicate that preleukemic {HSCs} can survive induction chemotherapy, identifying these cells as a reservoir for the reevolution of relapsed disease. Finally, through the study of several cases of relapsed {AML}, we demonstrate various evolutionary patterns for the generation of relapsed disease and show that some of these patterns are consistent with involvement of preleukemic {HSCs}. These findings provide key insights into the monitoring of minimal residual disease and the identification of therapeutic targets in human {AML}.},

By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems ({KRT}20 versus {CA}1, {MS}4A12, {CD}177, {SLC}26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures.},
